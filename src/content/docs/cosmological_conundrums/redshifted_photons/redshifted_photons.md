Where does the energy go when photons are redshifted by the expansion of the universe?

* Nowhere: the wavelength is just being measured by galaxies that were initially receding from the source.
* Converted: it is converted to gravitational potential energy as it is climbing out of a universe that was denser in the past.
* Lost: energy is not conserved in the expanding universe.
* All of the above.

## Intuition

It certainly seems like energy is not conserved.

With the following energy density evolutions,

<!-- For customising colours, I'd pick 300/400 from https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors -->
<!-- For changing size and style, see https://katex.org/docs/supported.html#style-color-size-and-font -->

```math
\huge
\begin{aligned}
\color{#2dd4bf}   \rho_M       &=  \color{#2dd4bf} \rho_{M_0} a^{-3} \\
\color{#f87171}   \rho_R       &=  \color{#f87171} \rho_{R_0} a^{-4} \\
\color{#22d3ee}   \rho_\Lambda &=  \color{#22d3ee} \rho_{\Lambda_0}
\end{aligned}
```

it certainly seems that as our universe expands, the total energy indeed changes:


```math
\huge
\begin{aligned}
\color{#2dd4bf}    E_M          &=   \color{#2dd4bf}  E_{M_0} \\
\color{#f87171}    E_R          &=   \color{#f87171}  E_{R_0} a^{-1} \\
\color{#22d3ee}    E_\Lambda    &=   \color{#22d3ee}  E_{\Lambda_0} a^3
\end{aligned}
```
